How to Create Your Personalized  GitHub Profile Page – GitHub Profile README Guide
Have you ever wanted to spruce up your GitHub profile page and make it stand out? Well, you're in luck!

With just a few simple steps, you can create a personalized GitHub profile that showcases your skills, projects, and personality. Let's dive in.

Create A New Repository
Go to GitHub and click on the "New" button to create a new repository.

Setup Your Repository
You should see a new page where you can create the new repo and it should look something like this:

Make sure the name of the repository is the same as your GitHub username, otherwise this won't work.

You can see that after entering your username, there's a new note showing right below the repository name field that says, "this will create a special repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README to get started."

The error for the repository name is showing because I already have my profile, you won't face this issue.

So, lets do this. First, keep the GitHub repository public and not private.

Then click on the add a README file checkbox so that after creating the repository, GitHub will automatically add a README file to that repository.

Next, click the "Create repository" button.

After successfully creating the repository, you should be redirected to the repository page, and you should see the README.md file.
